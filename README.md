# Breaking Bad API Assessment

This project was created as part of my application to Holler. There is no need to run the code locally to see it in action. Please go to the [github deployment](https://14amoore.github.io/breakingBad/). Should you want to run the code locally please clone this repo and the run it using a local server.

I made this using vanilla js instead of a framework because for simple project such as this one frameworks tend to be overkill.

When the characters load initially they are displayed in the order they are received in. Users have the option to sort the characters from A to Z, or Z to A.

## Testing

To run the tests simply type "npm run test" into your terminal's command line.

## To Build

To bundle the JS files for deployment type "npx webpack" into your terminal's command line.
