# Breaking Bad API Assessment

This project was created as part of my application to Holler. There is no need to run the code locally to see it in action. Please go to the [gitHub deployment](https://14amoore.github.io/breakingBad/). Should you want to run the code locally please clone this repo and the run it using a local server.
